The application of statistical methods to identify differentially expressed genes between ovarian cancer patients with different survival status. Explores Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing data and Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133a microarray to find gene expression markers associated with the survival of TCGA ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV).

Approaches Used:
- t-test
- Wilcoxon rank-sum 
- Bonferroni correction with t-test
- FDR with t-test
